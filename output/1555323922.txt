Techopedia explains Application Programming Interface
(API)

The API is a library of available Java classes, packages and interfaces.
The three API types are as follows:

- Official Java core API, which is bundled with the JDK download

- Optional ofﬁcial Java APls, which may be downloaded if needed

- Unofﬁcial APls, which are third-party APls that may be downloaded
from source websites

The APls help programmers detennine class or package functions,
parameters and other necessary information. The official API includes
packages, e.g., applet packages, graphics and GUI swing packages,
inputloutpui (IO) packages and Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT), among
others.

There are three frames when an API starts, as follows:

- The first frame shows all API components (classes and packages).

- When a panicular package is selected, the second frame shows all
interfaces, classes and exceptions of that particular package.

- The third and primary frame provides an overview of all of API
packages, which can be expanded in the main frame to show the
index, class hierarchy and help sections.
